dear Hicham,
i am sorry for my later answer. I was travelling so much and its so bussy preparing january fashion weeks.

it was really nice to meet you aswell.
I told my boyfriend about your project and he said he might be able to help with porsche panamera and the technical solution.

here is his contact.
I think its best to reach him by email.

Lets keep in touch. let us know when you come to düsseldorf, or next time in paris.

All the best, eva
