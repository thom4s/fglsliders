Dear Eva,

It was great to meet you Friday evening at Lucy's and Buchholz's dinner.  I thought it was very interesting to hear about your work. As spoken about it would be great to get in touch with your boyfriend considering the Porsche Panamera or to be directed to whom to talk to within the structure of the company. 

As said Fondation d'enterprise Galeries Lafayette is a foundation dedicated to new commissions in art, design and fashion and for the artist Yngve Holen, more about the artist here - http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/in-focus-yngve-holen/ we are looking for a Porsche Panamera.

Do let me know if you require more information.

Looking forward to your reply,

and wish you all the best,

Hicham
